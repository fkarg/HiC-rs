Meeting 2019-03-04

primary:
- start using setuptools-rust or similiar (stable)
- conda package in channel creation
- notebook look at HiC-data

additional:
- can we access the python datatype from rust directly? (scipy.sparse.csr_matrix)
- implement using (sparse) symmetric matrix


note:
hicinfo.py


Work done:
compared different ways to use rust from python
main three ways:
- pyO3: more or less impossible to write idiomatic rust. requires nightly.
- rust-cpython: possible to use pure rust, but has weird wrapper around it
- dylib (c-lib): needs to communicate over c-types, but works quite well otherwise
